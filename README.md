# gleamkit

This experimental repo is a starter kit for writing **HTTP APIs in Gleam** based on `wisp`, 
aiming to provide a simple and opinionated setup that is **production-ready**
(even though Gleam is still a very cutting edge language)

## Development

```sh
gleam build  # Build the project
gleam run   # Run the service
```
